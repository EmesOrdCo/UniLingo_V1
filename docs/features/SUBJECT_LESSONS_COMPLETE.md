# Subject Lessons Implementation - Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete lesson system for subject-based learning, allowing users to tap on any subject box and access a full lesson flow with multiple exercises, just like the PDF-based lessons.

## What Was Built

### 1. SubjectLessonService (`src/lib/subjectLessonService.ts`)
A comprehensive service to fetch and format subject lesson data from the database.

**Key Features:**
- Fetches vocabulary from `subject_words` table by subject name
- Fetches lesson scripts from `lesson_scripts` table
- Multi-language support (French, Spanish, German, Mandarin, Hindi)
- Formats vocabulary for lesson exercises
- Provides translation helpers based on user's native language

**Main Methods:**
```typescript
// Get complete lesson data for a subject
getSubjectLesson(subjectName: string, nativeLanguage: string): Promise<SubjectLessonData>

// Get lesson script in user's native language
getLessonScriptForLanguage(lessonScript, nativeLanguage): string

// Get translation for vocabulary item
getTranslation(vocab, nativeLanguage): string

// Format vocabulary for exercises
formatVocabularyForExercises(vocabulary, nativeLanguage): Array<...>
```

### 2. SubjectLessonScreen (`src/screens/SubjectLessonScreen.tsx`)
A full-featured lesson screen modeled after `LessonWalkthroughScreen`.

**Exercise Flow:**
1. **Flow Preview** (Default view)
   - Shows subject info card with word count
   - Displays all available exercises
   - Shows completion checkmarks for completed exercises
   - "Complete Lesson" button appears after completing any exercise

2. **Available Exercises:**
   - üìá Flashcards - Learn vocabulary with flashcards
   - ‚ùì Quiz - Test your knowledge
   - üîÄ Word Scramble - Unscramble vocabulary words
   - ‚ÜîÔ∏è Sentence Scramble - Reorder sentences
   - ‚úèÔ∏è Fill in the Blank - Complete sentences
   - üéß Listen - Audio comprehension
   - üé§ Speak - Pronunciation practice

3. **Completion Screen**
   - Shows completion celebration
   - Displays stats (score, exercises completed, word count)
   - Awards XP based on performance
   - Returns to subjects list

**Key Features:**
- Active time tracking (pauses when app is backgrounded)
- XP rewards on completion
- Progress tracking per exercise
- Native language support for all content
- Exit confirmation to prevent accidental navigation

### 3. Navigation Integration

**Files Modified:**
- `src/types/navigation.ts` - Added `SubjectLesson` route type
- `App.tsx` - Registered `SubjectLessonScreen` in navigator
- `src/components/SubjectBoxes.tsx` - Updated to navigate to lesson screen

**Navigation Parameters:**
```typescript
SubjectLesson: { 
  subjectName: string;    // Required: name of the subject
  cefrLevel?: string;     // Optional: CEFR level badge
}
```

### 4. SubjectBoxes Update
Updated to navigate to the new lesson screen instead of showing an alert.

**Before:**
```typescript
Alert.alert('Coming Soon', 'Subject lessons will be available soon!');
```

**After:**
```typescript
navigation.navigate('SubjectLesson', {
  subjectName: subject.name,
  cefrLevel: subject.cefrLevel,
});
```

## User Flow

### Starting a Lesson
1. User opens app and sees subject boxes on dashboard

### Completing Exercises
1. User taps on an exercise (e.g., "Flashcards")
2. Exercise component loads with subject vocabulary
3. User completes the exercise

CREATE TABLE subject_words (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  word_phrase TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  cefr_level TEXT,
  french_translation TEXT,
  spanish_translation TEXT,
  german_translation TEXT,

### Sample Data

To test the system, ensure you have data in `subject_words`:

-- Example: Geography & Places subject
INSERT INTO subject_words (
  word_phrase, subject, cefr_level,
  french_translation, example_sentence_english, example_sentence_french
) VALUES
  ('mountain', 'Geography & Places', 'A1', 
   'montagne', 'The mountain is very tall.', 'La montagne est tr√®s haute.'),
  ('river', 'Geography & Places', 'A1',
   'rivi√®re', 'The river flows to the sea.', 'La rivi√®re coule vers la mer.'),
  ('city', 'Geography & Places', 'A1',
   'ville', 'I live in a big city.', 'J''habite dans une grande ville.');
