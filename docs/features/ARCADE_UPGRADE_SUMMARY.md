## Play Tips! 🎮

**Breakout Deluxe:**
- Aim for bricks with glowing white dots - they have power-ups!
- Save the laser power-up for metal brick formations
- Multi-ball is best for clearing large sections quickly
- Metal bricks can't be destroyed - plan your angles around them

**Asteroids:**
- Use thrust sparingly - momentum carries you!
- Shoot large asteroids from a distance to avoid the split pieces
- Small UFOs are rare but worth 1000 points!
- The thrust flame shows your current direction
- Position yourself near the center when clearing the last asteroid
