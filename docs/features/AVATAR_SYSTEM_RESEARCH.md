---

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. **Database Schema (Supabase)**

```sql
-- Avatar configurations table
CREATE TABLE user_avatars (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  avatar_config JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Avatar items catalog
CREATE TABLE avatar_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  category TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'hair', 'clothes', 'accessories'
  item_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- specific type like 'hairStyle', 'top', 'glasses'
  item_value TEXT NOT NULL, -- the actual value for the avatar config
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  xp_cost INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_premium BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_unlocked_by_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  preview_image TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User's owned items
CREATE TABLE user_avatar_inventory (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  item_id UUID REFERENCES avatar_items(id),
  purchased_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, item_id)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_user_avatars_user_id ON user_avatars(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_inventory_user_id ON user_avatar_inventory(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_avatar_items_category ON avatar_items(category);
```

### 2. **Avatar Config Format (Example)**

```json
{
  "topType": "LongHairStraight",
  "accessoriesType": "Prescription02",
  "hairColor": "BrownDark",
  "facialHairType": "Blank",
  "clotheType": "Hoodie",
  "clotheColor": "PastelBlue",
  "eyeType": "Happy",
  "eyebrowType": "Default",
  "mouthType": "Smile",
  "skinColor": "Light"
}
```

### 3. **Monetization Strategy**

#### Free Items (Unlocked by Default):
- Basic hairstyles (5 options)
- Basic clothing (5 options)
- Basic colors
- Default accessories

#### XP-Purchasable Items:
- **100 XP:** Common items (additional hairstyles, simple accessories)
- **250 XP:** Uncommon items (unique clothing, fun accessories)
- **500 XP:** Rare items (premium hairstyles, special outfits)
- **1000 XP:** Epic items (exclusive collections)

#### Themed Collections:
- **"French Collection"** - Beret, striped shirt, etc. (500 XP bundle)
- **"Spanish Collection"** - Flamenco dress, castanets, etc. (500 XP bundle)
- **"Japanese Collection"** - Kimono, traditional accessories (500 XP bundle)

#### Seasonal Items:
- Holiday-themed items
- Event-specific items
- Limited-time offers

### 4. **Technical Integration Points**

#### React Native Component:
```typescript
import Avataaars from '@zamplyy/react-native-avataaars';

<Avataaars
  avatarStyle='Circle'
  topType='LongHairStraight'
  accessoriesType='Prescription02'
  hairColor='BrownDark'
  facialHairType='Blank'
  clotheType='Hoodie'
  clotheColor='PastelBlue'
  eyeType='Happy'
  eyebrowType='Default'
  mouthType='Smile'
  skinColor='Light'
  style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
/>
```

#### DiceBear Approach:
```typescript
import { createAvatar } from '@dicebear/core';
import { avataaars } from '@dicebear/collection';
import { SvgXml } from 'react-native-svg';

const avatar = createAvatar(avataaars, {
  seed: userId,
  // ... configuration options
});

const svgString = avatar.toString();

<SvgXml xml={svgString} width="100" height="100" />
```

### 5. **User Experience Flow**

1. **Onboarding:**
   - New users create their avatar during signup
   - Tutorial explains customization and shop

- **Optimize SVG:** Minimize SVG complexity for smooth rendering
- **Lazy loading:** Load shop items on demand
- **Image compression:** If caching as PNG, use appropriate compression
- **Memory management:** Don't keep all avatar variations in memory

### 7. **Future Enhancements**
