```sql
-- I can create this migration for you
ALTER TABLE subject_words ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS
  italian_translation TEXT,
  portuguese_translation TEXT,
  russian_translation TEXT,
  japanese_translation TEXT,
  korean_translation TEXT,
  arabic_translation TEXT;

-- I can create this function for you
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_content_by_language_pair(
  p_native_language TEXT,
  p_target_language TEXT,
  p_subject TEXT DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS TABLE (...);
```

### 1.2 Language Constants & Types

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for transforming UniLingo into a bidirectional multi-language platform. The plan clearly separates what I can help you with (code changes, logic implementation) from what you need to do (testing, deployment, monitoring).

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Thorough Testing**: Test each phase before moving to the next
2. **Cost Monitoring**: Monitor AI service costs throughout implementation
3. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback early and often
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure content quality meets your standards
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Consider phased rollout to minimize risk

**Estimated Timeline**: 8-10 weeks
**Estimated Cost Increase**: 20-60% per user (without validation)
**Risk Level**: Medium (with proper testing and monitoring)
