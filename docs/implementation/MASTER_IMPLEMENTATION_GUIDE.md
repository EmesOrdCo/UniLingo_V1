```

---

### Phase 3: Local Testing (20 minutes)

#### 3.1 Start Services Locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: Redis
redis-server

# Terminal 2: Web Service
cd backend
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
npm start
# Should see: "✅ Redis connected successfully"

# Terminal 3: Worker Service
cd backend
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
npm run worker
# Should see: "🚀 WORKER SERVICE STARTED"
```

#### 3.2 Run Validation Tests

```bash
# Terminal 4: Run all tests

# Test 1: Queue system
cd backend
./test-queue-system.sh
# Expected: All tests pass

# Test 2: Worker service
./test-worker-service.sh
# Expected: Job completes successfully

# Test 3: Circuit breaker
./test-circuit-breaker.sh
# Expected: All tests pass

# Test 4: Idempotency
./test-idempotency.sh
# Expected: Cache hits work
```

#### 3.3 Test SSE Notifications

```bash
# Open in browser:
open http://localhost:3001/sse-example.html

# Steps:
# 1. Click "Generate Flashcards"
# 2. Click "Connect to SSE"
# 3. Watch events appear in real-time!
# 4. Should see: connected → active → completed
```

---

### Phase 4: Staging Deployment (30 minutes)

#### 4.1 Deploy to Staging

```bash
# Deploy web service
railway up --environment staging

# Deploy worker service
railway up --service backend-worker --environment staging

# Verify both running
railway status
```

#### 4.2 Verify Connections

```bash
# Set staging URL
export BACKEND_URL="https://backend-staging.railway.app"
export WORKER_URL="https://backend-worker-staging.railway.app"

# Test 1: Web health
curl $BACKEND_URL/api/health

# Test 2: Worker health
curl $WORKER_URL/health

# Test 3: Redis health
curl $BACKEND_URL/api/redis/health

# Test 4: Queue stats
curl $BACKEND_URL/api/queue/stats

# All should return healthy/connected
```

#### 4.3 End-to-End Test

```bash
# 1. Enqueue job
curl -X POST $BACKEND_URL/api/ai/generate-flashcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "user-id: staging-test" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Staging test content with medical terms.",
    "subject": "Medicine",
    "topic": "Test",
    "userId": "staging-test"
  }'

# Save jobId from response

# 2. Check job status
curl $BACKEND_URL/api/job-status/[JOB_ID]

# 3. Watch worker logs
railway logs --service backend-worker --tail 50

# Should see:
# - Job picked up
# - Processing...
# - Job completed

# 4. Verify job completed
curl $BACKEND_URL/api/job-status/[JOB_ID]
# Expected: {"status": "completed", "result": {...}}
```

#### 4.4 Test SSE

```bash
# Open staging SSE demo
open https://backend-staging.railway.app/sse-example.html

# Follow same steps as local testing
```

---

### Phase 5: Production Deployment (15 minutes)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Only proceed if staging has been stable for 24 hours!

#### 5.1 Pre-Deployment Checklist

```bash
# Verify staging metrics
curl https://backend-staging.railway.app/api/metrics/alerts

# Check for alerts:
# ✅ alertsActive: 0
# ✅ circuitBreakers.openai.state: "CLOSED"
# ✅ queue.waiting: < 20
# ✅ performance.errorRate: < 5

# Review staging logs
railway logs --environment staging --service backend-worker | grep -E "(error|fail)" | tail -50

# Should be minimal errors
```

#### 5.2 Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy web service
railway up --environment production

# Deploy worker service
railway up --service backend-worker --environment production

# Verify deployment
railway status --environment production
```

#### 5.3 Post-Deployment Monitoring (First Hour)

```bash
# Watch logs closely
railway logs --environment production --service backend-worker --follow

# Check metrics every 5 minutes
watch -n 300 'curl -s https://backend.railway.app/api/metrics/alerts | jq'

# Look for:
# ✅ Jobs completing successfully
# ✅ No circuit breaker opens
# ✅ Queue depth stable
# ❌ No repeated errors
```

---

### Phase 6: Client Updates (Frontend Team)

#### 6.1 Update Flashcard Generation

**Old code (blocking):**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/generate-flashcards', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ content, subject, topic, userId })
});
const flashcards = response.flashcards;  // ❌ No longer works
```

**New code (queue-based):**
```javascript
// 1. Enqueue job
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/generate-flashcards', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ content, subject, topic, userId })
});
const { jobId } = response;

// 2a. Poll for result (simple)
while (true) {
  const status = await fetch(`/api/job-status/${jobId}`);
  if (status.status === 'completed') {
    const flashcards = status.result.flashcards;
    break;
  }
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000)); // Poll every 2s
}

// OR

// 2b. Use SSE (better UX)
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/job-events?jobId=${jobId}`);
eventSource.addEventListener('completed', (e) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
  const flashcards = data.result.flashcards;
  eventSource.close();
});
```

#### 6.2 Update Profile Loading (Issue #12)

**Old code:**
```javascript
const user = await fetch(`/api/user/${userId}`);
const lessons = await fetch(`/api/lessons/${userId}`);
const progress = await fetch(`/api/progress/${userId}`);
// 3-4 separate requests ❌
```

**New code:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/profile/${userId}`, {
  headers: { 'user-id': userId }
});
const { user, lessons, progress, manifestUrl, stats } = response.profile;
// 1 request ✅
```

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Redis"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check REDIS_URL is set
railway variables | grep REDIS_URL

# Verify Redis service running
railway status --service redis

# Test locally
redis-cli ping
```

---

### Issue: "Worker not picking up jobs"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check worker is running
railway status --service backend-worker

# Check worker logs
railway logs --service backend-worker --tail 50

# Verify environment variables copied
railway variables --service backend-worker | grep -E "(OPENAI|REDIS)"
```

---

### Issue: "Jobs failing with errors"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check specific job
curl https://backend.railway.app/api/job-status/[JOB_ID]

# Check circuit breaker
curl https://backend.railway.app/api/circuit-breakers/status

# Check worker logs
railway logs --service backend-worker | grep "Job failed" -A 10
```

---

### Issue: "Rate limit errors (429)"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reduce limits to be more conservative
railway variables set OPENAI_RATE_LIMIT_RPM=40
railway variables set OPENAI_MAX_CONCURRENT=3

# Restart worker
railway service restart --service backend-worker
```

---

## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS

### Queue-Based Architecture

```
Old: Client → Server → [Wait for OpenAI] → Response (30s)
New: Client → Server → Queue → Response (< 200ms)
              ↓
          Worker → OpenAI → Update job → SSE notify
```

### Multi-Layer Protection

```
Request → Fleet Throttle → Circuit Breaker → Retry Logic → Provider
          (Issue #13)       (Issue #6)        (Issue #8)

Each layer protects against different failure modes
```

### Caching Strategy

```
1. Idempotency (24h) - Prevent duplicate AI jobs
2. Profile (5min) - Fast profile loads  
3. Manifest (1h) - Stable data
```

---

## 📞 SUPPORT

### If Something Goes Wrong

**1. Check health endpoints:**
```bash
curl https://backend.railway.app/api/health
curl https://backend-worker.railway.app/health
curl https://backend.railway.app/api/redis/health
```

**2. Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs --service backend --tail 100
railway logs --service backend-worker --tail 100
```

**3. Check metrics:**
```bash
curl https://backend.railway.app/api/metrics/alerts
```

**4. Rollback if needed:**
```bash
railway rollback --service backend
railway rollback --service backend-worker
```
