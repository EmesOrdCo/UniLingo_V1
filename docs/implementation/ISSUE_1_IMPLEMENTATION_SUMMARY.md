## Stateful Code Identified

### üî¥ High Risk (Requires Redis Soon)

| Component | File | Lines | Risk | Next Issue |
|-----------|------|-------|------|------------|
| OpenAI request queue | `aiService.js` | 32 | Each instance has separate queue | Issue #2 |
| OpenAI rate limiter | `aiService.js` | 35-36 | May exceed limits with 2+ instances | Issue #2 |
| Circuit breaker | `aiService.js` | 37-38 | Per-instance state | Issue #2 |

### üü° Medium Risk (Acceptable for Now)

| Component | File | Lines | Risk | Next Issue |
|-----------|------|-------|------|------------|
| User rate limits | `server.js` | 72 | Per-instance, not global | Issue #3 |
| User tracking | `server.js` | 73 | Analytics split across instances | Issue #3 |

### üü¢ Low Risk (No Action Needed)

| Component | File | Lines | Risk | Action |
|-----------|------|-------|------|--------|
| Cleanup intervals | `server.js` | 180, 207 | Redundant but harmless | None |
| Performance monitor | `performanceMonitor.js` | N/A | Per-instance metrics | None |

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Set backend URL
export BACKEND_URL="https://your-backend-staging.railway.app"

# 2. Run validation script
cd backend
./test-horizontal-scaling.sh

# Expected: All tests pass
```

### Full Staging Test (1 hour)

```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging
railway up --environment staging

# 2. Enable autoscaling in Railway dashboard
#    Settings > Deployment > Replicas: Dynamic (min: 1, max: 2)

# 3. Run validation script
./backend/test-horizontal-scaling.sh

# 4. Monitor logs for 1 hour
railway logs --tail 100 --follow

# 5. Check for errors
railway logs | grep -E "(error|fail|429)"

# 6. Smoke tests
curl https://backend-staging.railway.app/api/health
curl -X POST https://backend-staging.railway.app/api/ai/generate-flashcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"test","subject":"test","topic":"test","userId":"test"}'
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Merging to Main

- [x] Code audit completed
- [x] Stateful components documented with warnings
- [x] Railway config updated
- [x] Validation script created and tested locally
- [x] Deployment guide written
- [x] PR description created
- [ ] **Run validation script in staging**
- [ ] **Enable autoscaling (min 1, max 2) in Railway**
- [ ] **Verify 2 instances can run simultaneously**
- [ ] **Monitor for 1 hour - no errors**
- [ ] **Smoke test all endpoints**
- [ ] **Team review approved**

### Before Production Deploy

- [ ] Staging stable for 24 hours
- [ ] No OpenAI rate limit errors
- [ ] No circuit breaker activations
- [ ] Response times < 500ms
- [ ] All acceptance tests passing
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard working
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

---

## How to Enable Autoscaling

### Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/[your-project-id]
2. Click **backend** service
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Find **Deployment** section
5. Change **Replicas** to **Dynamic**
6. Set:
   - Min Replicas: `1`
   - Max Replicas: `2` (staging) or `3` (production)
   - Scale Trigger: `CPU > 70%` or `Memory > 80%`
7. Click **Save**

### Railway CLI

```bash
railway service update --replicas-min 1 --replicas-max 2
railway status
```

## Known Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **These are ACCEPTABLE for Phase 1** - will be fixed in Issues #2 and #3:

1. **OpenAI Rate Limits** - Each instance counts separately
   - Risk: With 2 instances, could exceed 50 req/min
   - Mitigation: Circuit breaker stops requests if hit
   - Fix: Issue #2 (Redis queue)

2. **User Rate Limits** - Per-instance, not global
   - Risk: Users can exceed by hitting different instances
   - Mitigation: Still provides some protection
   - Fix: Issue #3 (Redis rate limiting)

3. **Circuit Breaker** - Not shared across instances
   - Risk: One blocks, others allow
   - Mitigation: Eventually all will hit same limits
   - Fix: Issue #2 (Redis circuit breaker)

---

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After (2 instances) |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Max concurrent users | ~50 | ~100 |
| Failure handling | Total outage | Service continues |
| Under heavy load | Slow response | Scales automatically |
| Cost | $10-20/month | $20-40/month |

---

## Rollback Options

### Option 1: Disable Autoscaling (Keep Code Changes)

```bash
# Railway Dashboard: Set Replicas to "Fixed (1)"
# or
railway service update --replicas-min 1 --replicas-max 1
```

### Option 2: Full Revert

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
railway up
```

---

## Monitoring After Deployment

### First Hour - Watch Closely

```bash
# Monitor logs
railway logs --tail 100 --follow

# Look for these issues:
# - "Rate limit exceeded" (OpenAI 429 errors)
# - "Circuit breaker opened"
# - Memory/CPU warnings
# - Errors or exceptions
```

### First 24 Hours - Periodic Checks

```bash
# Every 4 hours, check:
railway logs | grep -E "(error|fail|429)" | tail -50
railway status  # Verify instance count
curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/metrics
```

### Metrics to Track

1. **OpenAI 429 Errors** - Should be < 5/day
2. **Circuit Breaker Events** - Should be 0
3. **Instance Count** - Should auto-scale correctly
4. **Response Times** - Should stay < 500ms
5. **Error Rate** - Should stay < 1%

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All of these must be true before production deploy:

- [ ] 2 instances run simultaneously in staging
- [ ] Health checks pass on all instances
- [ ] No OpenAI rate limit errors (429)
- [ ] No circuit breaker activations
- [ ] Response time < 500ms average
- [ ] No errors in logs for 24 hours
- [ ] Smoke tests all pass
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible
- [ ] Team review approved

---

## Next Steps After Merge

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Deploy to staging
2. Enable autoscaling (min 1, max 2)
3. Monitor for 24 hours
4. Fix any issues found
5. Deploy to production (if stable)

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Start Issue #2: Redis queue migration
2. Monitor production metrics
3. Adjust autoscaling thresholds if needed

### Medium Term (Weeks 2-3)
1. Complete Issue #2 (Redis queue)
2. Start Issue #3 (Redis rate limiting)
3. Load testing at scale
