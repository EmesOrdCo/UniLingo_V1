## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `assets/games/` - Downloaded game repositories
- `backend/public/games/` - Games copied to backend for serving

- `ARCADE_GAMES_SETUP.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/arcade/GameWebView.tsx` - Updated to load games from backend

## üöÄ How to Deploy & Test

### Step 1: Add Games to Database

You need to run the SQL script in your Supabase database:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to SQL Editor

2. **Run the SQL Script**
   ```sql
   -- Copy the contents of populate_arcade_games.sql and run it
   ```
   - This will insert the 5 games into your `arcade_games` table

3. **Verify Games Were Added**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, category, difficulty, game_url 
   FROM arcade_games 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend Changes

The games are in `backend/public/games/` and need to be deployed:

**Option A: Deploy to Railway (Recommended)**
```bash
cd backend
git add public/games/
git commit -m "Add arcade games"
git push
```

**Option B: Test Locally First**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# Games will be accessible at:
# http://localhost:3001/games/hextris/index.html
# http://localhost:3001/games/2048/index.html
# etc.
```

### Step 3: Test in App

1. **Start your React Native app**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Navigate to Arcade**
   - Go to Progress Page
   - Tap on "Arcade" section
   - You should see 5 games listed

3. **Play a Game**
   - Tap on any game card
   - The game should load in a WebView
   - All games should be fully functional

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Games Not Loading?

1. **Check Backend is Running**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-backend-url.railway.app/games/hextris/index.html
   ```

2. **Check Database**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM arcade_games WHERE is_active = true;
   ```

3. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for errors in React Native debugger
   - Check WebView errors

### Games Load But Don't Work?

1. **Check Game Permissions**
   - Ensure `javaScriptEnabled={true}` in GameWebView
   - Check `allowsInlineMediaPlayback={true}` for games with sound

2. **Test Individual Games**
   - Open game directly in browser:
     `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/games/hextris/index.html`

### CORS Issues?

The backend already has CORS enabled, but if you see CORS errors:

```javascript
// In backend/server.js (already configured)
app.use(cors());
```

## üé® Customization

### Adding More Games

1. **Clone/Download Game**
   ```bash
   cd assets/games
   git clone [game-repo-url]
   ```

2. **Copy to Backend**
   ```bash
   cp -r assets/games/[game-name] backend/public/games/
   ```

3. **Add to Database**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO arcade_games (
     name, description, game_url, xp_cost, category, difficulty, is_active
   ) VALUES (
     'Game Name', 
     'Description', 
     'games/[game-name]/index.html', 
     0, 
     'arcade', 
     'medium', 
     true
   );
   ```

### Changing Game Costs

All games are currently **FREE** (xp_cost = 0). To add XP costs:

```sql
UPDATE arcade_games 
SET xp_cost = 50 
WHERE name = 'Hextris';
```

## üìù Notes

- All games are open-source and licensed appropriately
- Games are served from your backend, not embedded in the app
- This keeps your app size small
- Games load via WebView, so they need internet connection
- All 5 games are mobile-friendly and touch-enabled

---

## ‚ú® Testing Checklist

Before considering this complete, test:

- [ ] All 5 games appear in arcade
- [ ] Each game loads correctly

## üéâ You're Done!

Once you've run the SQL script and deployed the backend, your arcade should be fully functional with 5 classic games!
