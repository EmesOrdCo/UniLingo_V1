- **Card-based design** with clear visual hierarchy
- **Grid layout** for main levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)
- **List layout** for sublevels with "All Sub-Levels" option
- **Preview section** showing selected level with description
- **Haptic feedback** for better user experience
- **Responsive design** that works well on different screen sizes

### 2. Updated DashboardContent (`src/components/DashboardContent.tsx`)

- **Added clean "Change Level" button** that navigates to the new screen
- **Maintained all existing functionality** for level-based content filtering

### 3. Navigation Integration
- **Added LevelSelectionScreen** to the main navigation stack (`App.tsx`)
- **Updated navigation types** (`src/types/navigation.ts`) with proper parameters
- **Callback system** to return selected levels to the dashboard

### 4. Internationalization
- **Added translations** for the new screen in both English and German
- **Consistent terminology** with existing dashboard translations
- **Proper localization** for all UI elements

### 5. Testing
