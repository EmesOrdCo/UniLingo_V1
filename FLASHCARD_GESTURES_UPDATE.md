# Flashcard Gesture System Update

## Overview
Updated the flashcard system in the Games page (`FlashcardStudyScreen.tsx`) with new gesture-based interactions for a more intuitive user experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Swipe Gestures** ðŸ”„
- **Swipe Up**: Navigate to next card
- **Swipe Down**: Navigate to previous card
- Works on the entire screen area
- Available at any time (before or after revealing the answer)
- Smooth animated transitions when switching cards

### 2. **Tap Interactions** ðŸ‘†
- **Single Tap (anywhere on screen)**: Reveal/hide the answer (flip the card)
- **Double Tap (anywhere on screen)**: Automatically mark card as correct and move to next card
  - Works regardless of flip state (can double-tap before or after revealing)
  - Provides quick workflow for cards you know well
  - Tap detection works on the entire screen for maximum convenience

### 3. **Boundary Behavior** ðŸ›‘
- **First Card + Swipe Down**: No action (stays on first card)
- **Last Card + Swipe Up**: Automatically goes to review page

### 4. **Visual Feedback** âœ¨
- **Beautiful gradient background**: Soft purple-to-blue gradient (`#f0f4ff` â†’ `#e0e7ff` â†’ `#ddd6fe`)
- **Animated geometric background**: Floating circles and diamond shapes that gently move around
  - 4 decorative circles with subtle purple/white colors and soft shadows
  - 2 floating diamond shapes with transparent borders
  - Each element has unique floating animation (3-4.5 second cycles)
  - Creates dynamic, engaging background without being distracting
- Animated card transitions (slide up/down effect)
- **Green thumbs up bubble celebration** when marking cards as correct:
  - 6 animated green thumbs-up icons (using Ionicons) with organic bubble effect
  - Start together from behind the card and spread out as they float upward
  - Float up 300-400px (varying random heights for organic feel)
  - Icons scale from 0.5x to 1.0-1.3x as they rise (like bubbles growing)
  - Varying speeds (1200-1800ms) create natural bubble movement
  - Icons go behind the header as they reach the top
  - Triggers on both double-tap and pressing the Correct button
- **Elegant gesture hints at top of screen**:
  - Three responsive pill-shaped hints below the progress bar
  - "Tap to reveal" with hand icon
  - "Swipe to navigate" with swap icon  
  - "Double-tap = correct" with hand outline icon
  - Semi-transparent white background with purple borders
  - Responsive layout: flexes to fit all screen sizes
  - Compact design with smaller text and padding for mobile screens
- Progress bar shows current position
- Smooth animations using React Native Animated API
- Flashcards are centered on screen for better focus
- Semi-transparent headers with subtle shadows for depth

### 5. **Audio Features** ðŸ”Š
- Audio pronunciation button always visible on every card
- Plays text-to-speech for currently displayed text (adapts to flip state and language mode)
- Works even if no pronunciation data exists in database
- Uses expo-speech on mobile, Web Speech API on web

### 6. **Haptic Feedback** ðŸ“³
- **Card flip** (single tap): Light impact feedback
- **Correct answer** (double-tap or Correct button): Success notification haptic
- **Incorrect answer** (Incorrect button): Error notification haptic
- **Card navigation** (swipe up/down): Light impact feedback
- Provides tactile confirmation for all major interactions
- Uses expo-haptics for iOS and Android

### 7. **Retained Features** âœ…
- Correct/Incorrect buttons still available for manual selection
- All tracking and XP features maintained

## Technical Implementation

### New Dependencies
- Added `Animated` and `PanResponder` from React Native
- Added `expo-haptics` for tactile feedback
- Added `expo-linear-gradient` for beautiful gradient backgrounds
- Added refs for animation state and double-tap detection

### Key Functions
1. `handleTap()` - Detects double-tap vs single tap (300ms delay), works anywhere on screen
2. `animateCard()` - Handles card transition animations
3. `goToNextCard()` - Navigate forward with animation
4. `goToPreviousCard()` - Navigate backward with animation
5. `triggerThumbsUpAnimation()` - Creates celebratory bubble effect for correct answers:
   - 6 green thumbs-up icons with organic bubble animation
   - Start together and spread out as they rise (50ms stagger for quick bubble effect)
   - Random heights: -300 to -400px for natural variation
   - Scale animation: 0.5x â†’ 1.0-1.3x (random sizes, like bubbles growing)
   - Varying speeds: 1200-1800ms based on index (organic movement)
   - Horizontal spread: Â±180px from center (60px per thumb)
   - Z-index layering: bubbles (1) < card (10) < header (100)
   - Fade in (150ms) â†’ rise and grow â†’ fade out (300ms)
   - Total animation duration: ~1.5-2.1 seconds (varies per bubble)
6. `panResponder` - Handles all gestures (swipes and taps):
   - Detects swipes with 50px threshold
   - Detects taps with 10px threshold (minimal movement)
   - Allows child components (buttons) to handle their own touches first

### Animation Details
- Uses `translateY` transform for slide animations
- 200ms duration for smooth transitions
- Prevents multiple simultaneous animations with `isAnimating` ref
- Bubble effect uses combined transforms: `translateY`, `translateX`, and `scale`
- Z-index hierarchy for proper layering:
  - Thumbs up bubbles: z-index 1 (back layer)
  - Flashcard & buttons: z-index 10 (middle layer)
  - Header with title/progress: z-index 100 (front layer, bubbles go behind it)

### Visual Design
- **Gradient Background**: Linear gradient from light purple to soft blue
- **Animated Background Elements**: Floating geometric shapes that move gently
- **Semi-transparent Elements**: Headers use `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)` for glass-like effect
- **Subtle Shadows**: Purple-tinted shadows (`#6366f1`) for depth and cohesion
- **Border Transparency**: Semi-transparent borders (`rgba(226, 232, 240, 0.3)`)
- **Layered Design**: Creates depth with gradient background, floating cards, and transparent overlays
- **Gesture Hints**: Pill-shaped hints with icons, semi-transparent backgrounds, and subtle purple borders

## User Experience Flow

1. User sees first flashcard (centered on screen) with gesture hints at the top
2. Three elegant pill-shaped hints show available actions:
   - "Tap to reveal" with hand icon
   - "Swipe to navigate" with swap icon
   - "Double-tap = correct" with hand outline icon
3. Can swipe up/down anywhere to navigate anytime (feels light haptic)
4. Single tap anywhere reveals the answer (feels light haptic)
5. Double tap anywhere (any time) marks as correct with:
   - Success haptic feedback
   - Celebratory bubble animation with 6 green thumbs
6. Green thumbs-up bubbles float up from behind the card, spreading out naturally
7. Bubbles disappear behind the header as they reach the top
8. Or use Correct/Incorrect buttons for manual selection:
   - Correct: Success haptic + bubble animation
   - Incorrect: Error haptic (no bubbles)
9. Smooth animations and haptics guide the user through the deck
10. Last card swipe up automatically shows review page
11. Gesture hints remain visible throughout the session for reference

## Files Modified
- `/src/screens/FlashcardStudyScreen.tsx` - Main implementation

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test single tap to flip (should feel light haptic)
2. Test double tap to mark correct (should show bubble animation + success haptic)
3. Test swipe up/down navigation (should feel light haptic on transition)
4. Test boundary conditions (first/last card)
5. Test audio button works for all cards (with and without pronunciation data)
6. Test Correct/Incorrect buttons still work:
   - Correct button: bubble animation + success haptic
   - Incorrect button: error haptic (no bubbles)
7. Verify bubble effect looks organic (thumbs start together, spread out as they rise)
8. Check that bubbles scale up naturally (small to larger)
9. Confirm bubbles go behind the header at the top
10. Test animations are smooth on both iOS and Android
11. Verify bubble animation doesn't interfere with other interactions
12. Test that flashcards are properly centered on different screen sizes
13. Verify varying bubble heights and speeds create natural movement
14. Confirm haptics work correctly on physical devices (may not work in simulator)
15. Verify different haptic patterns feel appropriate for each action
